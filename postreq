Here are several examples of different types of HTTP POST requests:

Form Data:

makefile
Copy code
POST /submit-form HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

username=johndoe&password=secret123
In this example, the data is sent as form-urlencoded. The body contains key-value pairs separated by &, and each pair is separated by =.
This is commonly used in HTML forms.
JSON Data:

bash
Copy code
POST /api/users HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "johndoe@example.com",
  "age": 30,
  "active": true
}
Here, the data is sent as JSON format in the request body.
This is common when interacting with REST APIs that consume and produce JSON data.
Multipart Form Data:

bash
Copy code
POST /upload-file HTTP/1.1
Host: upload.example.com
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=---------------------------1234567890
